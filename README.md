This is the backend API project for MyHabit, a personal habit tracker designed for effective habit management. The core problem this project solves is the lack of motivation that comes from generic tracking. It will provide smart, type-specific feedback like "clean streaks" for habits I am quitting and "success streaks" for habits I am building.
